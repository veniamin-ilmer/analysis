# Tic Tac Toe

I ran a simulation of every possible move in Tic Tac Toe and gathered statistics over possibilities of winning.

Note that the percentages do not represent perfect play. Rather, they represent the percentages of possible wins or losses. This is representative of how simple computer game algorithms judge where to go next.

Pay attention to the places where a tie is a low percentage. With perfect play, a player can use the low tie percentage to force a win.

Before starting the game, it is interesting to note:

* The first player has *51%* possibilities for winning.
* The second player has *31%* possibilities for winning.
* There are *18%* possibilities for having a tie.

Assume first player is **X**. Assume second player is **O**.

Below are all the possibilities for each turn. If a turn isn't listed, rotate the board. You will find a rotation / flip of the board that corresponds to your game.
