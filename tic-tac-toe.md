# Tic Tac Toe

I ran a simulation of every possible move in Tic Tac Toe and gathered statistics over possibilities of winning.

Below you can click on each move and get the resulting possibilities for each.

Before starting the game, it is interesting to note:

* The first player has *51%* possibilities for winning.
* The second player has *31%* possibilities for winning.
* There are *18%* possibilities for having a tie.

Assume first player is **X**. Assume second player is **O**.
