#Tic Tac Toe

I ran a simulation of every possible move in Tic Tac Toe and gathered statistics over possibilities of winning.

Below you can click on each move and get the resulting possibilities for each.

Before starting the game, it is interesting to note:

* The first player has 51% possibilities for winning.
* The second player has 31% possibilities for winning.
* There are 18% possibilities for having a tie.

Assume first player is **X**. Assume second player is **O**.

It is **X**'s turn. Click and cell to see further possibilities.
